# Android Development Crash Course 

Because GrapheneOS (and thus Starknet Phone) is based on android, it is compatiable 
with Android native applications. This will be a broad overview on how Android 
development is approached in this project. 

## Environment/Android Studio setup

Android applications are best developed in Android Studio or Intellij. This will 
focus on Android Studio.

## A More Complicated Example 

This project will place a strong emphasis on Jetpack Compose.

Android provides number of examples using this approach, of which we will be 
following the decisions of the JetNews example linked below.

## Using Rust 

In some cases (like the Beerus client) we will not be able to use Kotlin for everything in an 
application. For this, follow the [rust in android guide](./rust-in-android.md)
